# FallSafe
A fall alert system for vulnerable members of the public

Fall Safe is an automated fall alert system for the elderly and other vunerable people,
particularly those with dementia. I created it to help those vunerable people be
safer at home in hope that it would reduce the stress on the health care industry and
keep them at home for longer.
